    * Improve and reorganize documentation into smaller sections

IPC::Pipeline 0.3

    A release to fix documentation which was inconsistent with the previous
    implementation regarding the way the file handle positional parameters
    were being handled.  This also fixes the code to allow receipt of file
    typeglobs, numeric file descriptors, and the usual positional scalar
    substitution method.  Note that an implicit dependency upon POSIX::dup2()
    is now made if numeric file descriptors are passed, as a workaround to
    undesirable multiple calls to the dup2() system call by Perl's open()
    when used in the expected (but unexpectedly resultant) manner.

    Some 80-column comment tweaks are also made in this release.

IPC::Pipeline 0.2

    Initial release, 2 June 2010.
